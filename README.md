## Simulated Annealing
![Alt text](images/Simulated_Annealing.jpg)

This project aimed to create a simple and visual application of the Simulated Annealing metaheuristic in the context of image processing.

Starting from a matrix that represents an image, the algorithm gradually converges to the target image, and it is possible to observe the entire conversion process executed by the algorithm.

The algorithm used is based on the original article proposed by Kirkpatrick et al. (1983).

## Starbucks Reviews EDA, NLP and ML
![Alt text](images/Starbucks_Reviews_EDA_NLP_ML.jpg)

This project aimed to carry out exploratory data analysis, NLP and the creation of a machine learning model to predict review scores based on comments.

From a comment it is possible to indicate the prediction of the rating given by the customer. This score varies between 1 and 5.

## Text Based Nps Predictor
![Alt text](images/text_based_nps_predictor.png)

This project aimed to create a classifier using NLP techniques to predict a customer's NPS (Net Promoter Score) based on comments entered by the user.

From a comment, it is possible to indicate the prediction of the customer's NPS classification, which can be: Detractor, neutral or promoter.

![Alt text](images/streamlit_record.gif)

Using the model, it is possible to speed up the evaluation of comments and the NPS classification in order to enable a faster response to a company's customers.

A customer completed a satisfaction survey and is very dissatisfied? It is possible to detect this in real time with the trained model and initiate a cancellation prevention action, for example triggering a communication or alert in the customer relationship center.

## Data Science Applied to Military Enlistment
![Alt text](images/Data-Science-Aplicado-ao-Alistamento-Militar.png)

The objective of the project is to analyze demographic data regarding people who enlist and predict the conditions that imply selection to serve in the Brazilian army.

I also made a publication on Medium describing in detail each step taken in this analysis.

## Analyzing the National Vaccination Campaign against Covid-19 with Data Science

Which group has been vaccinated the most so far? How old is the oldest Brazilian who has already been vaccinated? Who leads the ranking of vaccinated people, men or women? Which manufacturer is the most commonly used vaccine? What is the average age of those vaccinated? What is the predominant color among those already vaccinated? These and other questions will be answered in this project.
