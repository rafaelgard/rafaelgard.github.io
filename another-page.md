## ðŸ’» Latest Projects
Currently, I have 13 projects in my portfolio. You can check each of them below:

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->

## Implementing a hybrid of genetic algorithm and simulated annealing for the vehicle routing problem in Julia
![Alt â€‹â€‹text](images/genetic_alg.png)

This project aimed to create a simple application of the genetic algorithm meta-heuristic applied to the vehicle routing problem (VRP), using the Julia language. The Julia language was chosen because it is a high-performance language with speed compared to the C language.

## Optimization Projects with Gurobi, Highs and Pyomo
![Alt text](images/optimizations_projects.jpg)

This repository contains implementations of 4 optimization problems, all developed using the Gurobipy, Pyomo, Highspy libraries, and the GLPK solver. The solutions provide optimized approaches to challenges related to vessel routing, fuel allocation on ships, and drone routing for surveillance of areas of interest.

## Simulated Annealing
![Alt text](images/Simulated_Annealing.jpg)

This project aimed to create a simple and visual application of the Simulated Annealing metaheuristic in the context of image processing.

Starting from a matrix that represents an image, the algorithm gradually converges to the target image, and it is possible to observe the entire conversion process executed by the algorithm.

The algorithm used is based on the original article proposed by Kirkpatrick et al. (1983).

## Text Based Nps Predictor
![Alt text](images/text_based_nps_predictor.png)

This project aimed to create a classifier using NLP techniques to predict a customer's NPS (Net Promoter Score) based on comments entered by the user.

From a comment, it is possible to indicate the prediction of the customer's NPS classification, which can be: Detractor, neutral or promoter.

![Alt text](images/streamlit_record.gif)

Using the model, it is possible to speed up the evaluation of comments and the NPS classification in order to enable a faster response to a company's customers.

A customer completed a satisfaction survey and is very dissatisfied? It is possible to detect this in real time with the trained model and initiate a cancellation prevention action, for example triggering a communication or alert in the customer relationship center.

## Starbucks Reviews EDA, NLP and ML
![Alt text](images/Starbucks_Reviews_EDA_NLP_ML.jpg)

This project aimed to carry out exploratory data analysis, NLP and the creation of a machine learning model to predict review scores based on comments.

From a comment it is possible to indicate the prediction of the rating given by the customer. This score varies between 1 and 5.
